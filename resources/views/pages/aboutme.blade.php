                    I’ve been a professional developer for more than 10 years and I’ve been programming daily for about 20 years, and as Socrates said:

                    I know that I know nothing 😅😆
                    <br><br>
                    I have an insane drive to every single day become a better programmer, co-worker, friend, husband, father, person, etc. 😉

                    We are 🐍 what we repeatedly do, so, excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit 🐲
