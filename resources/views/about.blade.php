                                    At the end of 2017 and by some random not so random events the web development dragged me to its world and since then I haven't been able to escape from it, yet.

                                    At the moment I'm some kind of mix between a QA and a
                                    backend developer hoping to master the TALL stack & TDD methodology

                                    This challenge took me 25+/- hrs to complete and was really fun to do (not the css yet, but eventaully it will be fun too). While I think it was kind of easy to do, I decided to make it a little harder by doing it through TDD.

                                    If it gets the chance to be reviewed I'd really love to hear some feedback so I can become a better developer.
