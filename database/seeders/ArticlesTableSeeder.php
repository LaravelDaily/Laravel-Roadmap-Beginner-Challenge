A <a href="https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/6/13/a-superior-financial-system"><strong>superior financial system</strong></a> needs to remain accessible and low cost for all. While ETH 2.0 will go a long way in getting us there, that roadmap is still unfolding, and the time for layer-2 (L2) solutions is now.&nbsp;</p><p>Winning L2 solutions should maintain all the properties that make Ethereum great — permissionless, secure, community-owned — at lower cost than the base chain. To date, the mixture of maturity and tradeoffs found in competing designs has created a conundrum for the community: we could either choose the superior security, throughput, and capital efficiency of ZK rollups (ZKRs), or the EVM compatibility of less-secure fraud-proof systems like Optimistic rollups (ORs). The risk we face is that some teams choose the former, while others choose the latter, prioritizing different tradeoffs, fragmenting liquidity, and breaking composability.</p><p>It would be far easier if we weren’t forced to choose at all—if we could have the security, throughput, and efficiency of ZKRs alongside EVM compatibility, making it easier to converge on a common standard. Turns out, that’s <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-0-hello-ethereum-ca48588de179"><strong>zkSync 2.0, with the zkEVM</strong></a>. Yes, zkSync 2.0 is EVM compatible, and shipping in Q4 2021.</p><p>For those that can’t wait, there’s already <a href="https://twitter.com/zksync/status/1415469227859845120?s=20"><strong>zkSync 1.x, which provides permissionless ERC-20 token listings and support for NFTs.</strong></a> Live since June 2020, the original zkSync has had the lowest real transaction costs across all existing and planned rollups, leading teams like <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1410595995864367110?s=20"><strong>Gitcoin</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/blog/layer-2-plans/"><strong>Argent</strong></a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/indexcoop/status/1417584862303715331?s=20"><strong>Index Coop</strong></a> to trust zkSync with their scaling needs.</p><p>zkSync best preserves the properties that have made Ethereum successful thus far: decentralization, security, composability, capital efficiency, and instant withdrawals. At the same time, it minimizes the disruption faced by developers who are used to building contracts for the EVM. As a result, we believe zkSync paves the smoothest path to scaling DeFi, NFTs, and all other innovations happening on Ethereum.</p><p>Before we get into specifics, it’s worth reflecting on how we got here. This discussion points to the conclusion that the challenge ahead is not only to scale, but to do so in a way that safeguards the core properties that got Ethereum this far.</p><p><strong>The road to 2021</strong></p><p>In 2013, long before Ethereum’s first block, Vitalik published the Ethereum Whitepaper. In it, he envisioned applications of the soon-to-be smart contract protocol: stablecoins, derivatives, oracles, prediction markets, DAOs.</p><p>From early on, critics of Ethereum were quick to point out that the initial design was unlikely to support such applications on a global scale. But scalability was the least of Ethereum’s problems. It wasn’t clear who would build these things. It was even less clear whether anyone would use them.</p><p>It wasn’t long before faster, cheaper smart contract protocols emerged, amassing huge venture-backed war chests by selling heavily to insiders. These projects proclaimed Ethereum legacy tech, despite fundraising off the back of Ethereum’s 2017 success. Amidst the doom and gloom of the 2018 and 2019 bear market, Ethereum hackathons were <a href="https://twitter.com/ljxie/status/1048415228977795073?s=20"><strong>packed</strong></a>. Despite every L1 and their sister claiming they were destined to eat Ethereum’s lunch, Ethereum’s developers weren’t leaving.&nbsp;</p><p>Piece by piece, an ecosystem of interconnected protocols and applications have emerged on Ethereum, a large number of them financially geared. Today we call this nexus “DeFi,” and it’s one of the most dynamic and fun corners of the internet. In 2020, nearly all the applications Vitalik dreamed up in the Ethereum whitepaper were live on Ethereum, as were dozens more that couldn’t have been imagined when Ethereum was born. And not only do they exist,<a href="https://cryptofees.info/"><strong> users are paying millions of dollars per day to use them</strong></a>, and they store <a href="https://defillama.com/home"><strong>tens of billions in value</strong></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out, the fundamental properties of DeFi on Ethereum were more important than scalability. DeFi developers refused to sacrifice decentralization for scalability. They instead leveraged the composability and capital efficiency that Ethereum afforded them to overcome the limits of scalability. As these applications have now attracted <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/rchen8/defi-users-over-time"><strong>millions of users</strong></a>, scalability is front and center once again.</p><p>Here, there’s good news and bad news. The good news is the Ethereum community has been preparing for this moment for years, with multiple concurrent efforts, many of which are live today. In addition to proof-of-stake (PoS) and sharding in ETH 2.0, independent teams have pursued sidechains, rollups, plasma, state channels, and countless other proposals. The “bad” news is that fully-fledged layer-one (L1) scaling is a multi-year process, and developers are inundated with L2 choices in the meantime.</p><p>We can expect a variety of L2 solutions to be useful pieces to solving the scalability puzzle. But when it comes to scaling complex, open-participation, smart contracts such as those that comprise DeFi, one set of solutions stands out. As Vitalik pointed out in his post,<a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698"><strong> a rollup-centric Ethereum roadmap</strong></a>, the Ethereum community is likely to be focused on rollups as the core scaling strategy in the short-to-medium term.&nbsp;</p><p>This makes sense: Base-layer scalability through ETH 2.0 is still a few years away, but earlier phases of ETH 2.0 are imminently useful to rollups by providing a performant, low-cost data availability layer.</p><p><i>How did we arrive at rollups?</i></p><p>Rollups were born out of Plasma. In Plasma, an L1 contract holds funds and tracks cryptographic commitments to a sidechain state. The actual sidechain state is maintained by operators off-chain, with a tiny data footprint on L1. Rollups emerged as an iteration on Plasma intended to address the challenge of data availability by publishing some data about each transaction on L1. These transactions can then be “rolled up” into a single sidechain block.&nbsp;</p><p>Such a design “splits” the work between L1 and L2. L1 handles data availability, while L2 – the rollup, in this case – handles computation. While rollups can’t process as many transactions per second as Plasma, they also don’t suffer from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJT_fR7wexw"><strong>data withholding attacks</strong></a>: network participants can always reconstruct the most recent L2 state from the data posted to L1. While certain types of contracts may benefit from the Plasma approach, DeFi contracts cannot afford liveness failures. Meanwhile, rollups are orders of magnitude cheaper to use than L1.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of rollups: ORs and ZKRs. Both use L1 for data availability, but each has a different way of handling state transitions. ORs use fraud proofs: If an incorrect state transition is posted to the sidechain, someone needs to detect the fraud and successfully post a proof to the mainnet contract to prevent loss of funds. In contrast, ZKRs post a cryptographic proof that each state transition was correctly computed. Fraudulent transactions are ruled out a priori: a fraudulent proof will be rejected automatically, just as a regular Ethereum transaction with an invalid signature won’t be processed by the network. <strong>In our opinion, ZKRs are objectively superior and the likely long-term winning architecture, while ORs are an intermediate solution.</strong></p><p>As the zkSync team says, trust math, not validators.&nbsp; Crucially, security in ZKRs depends on cryptography, not game theory. Most L2 technologies, including Plasma and ORs, rely on a game of cat and mouse between the attacker and the honest parties. This type of security relies on assumptions about the behavior of different actors. Such assumptions may prove flawed as actors behave in complex ways that are hard to predict beforehand. In addition to unforeseen failure modes, game theory also increases the complexity of the design. By drawing security from pure cryptography, ZKRs offer higher reliability and simplicity, positioning them as uniquely capable of safeguarding Ethereum.</p><p>The validity-proof-based architecture also makes ZKRs significantly more capital efficient than fraud-proof L2s. State channels require full collateralization. ORs require users to lock up capital for around two weeks in order to give sufficient time for fraud proofs, in case something goes wrong. For ZKRs, this lockup is on the order of minutes. If we expect hundreds of billions worth of capital to live across L2 contracts, the difference in efficiency is determinative. Allowing capital to flow seamlessly to where it’s most valued is at the core of what’s made DeFi successful. ZKRs are our best bet of preserving this property as we migrate to L2.</p><p>Lastly, among rollups, ZKRs are poised to offer the greatest amount of raw scalability. The bottleneck for all rollups will inevitably be the cost of storing data on L1. For those who want even lower costs, there will be <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf"><strong>zkPorter which provides off-chain data availability (see below), with 20,000+ TPS available</strong></a>, and common transactions like “swaps” likely costing a few cents. zkPorter will ship with zkSync 2.0 in Q4 2021.</p><p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a479ee3b7411c6102f75729/1626893428162-GYQCLSGYKL6BXYOI30P6/Screen+Shot+2021-07-21+at+12.50.11+PM.png?format=1000w" alt="Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 12.50.11 PM.png"></p><p>Meanwhile, ZK proofs are becoming significantly more efficient, and the rate of development and innovation within the ZK community is breathtaking. ZK-architectures are quickly becoming the future. The first vector of efficiency improvement is coming through better software: The last few years have seen an<a href="https://medium.com/starkware/the-cambrian-explosion-of-crypto-proofs-7ac080ac9aed"><strong> explosion of new proof systems</strong></a> and improvements on key components of proving time and proof size. This trend shows no signs of abating and will inevitably lead to further improvements in efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>Another (independent) vector of improvement is hardware: A number of teams are building specialized hardware (FPGAs, ASICs) for ZK proofs. These efforts are expected to generate significant improvements in efficiency for generating cryptographic proofs. In other words, unlike other L2 architectures, ZKRs are benefiting from major software and hardware tailwinds. If we’re willing to bet on Moore’s law, we can expect the efficiency advantage of ZKRs to only widen with time.</p><p>Until recently, supporting expressive smart contracts had been considered the key challenge for ZKRs, and potentially one that would take years to solve. The zkSync community is bringing that solution to market in 2021 with zkSync 2.0, much sooner than expected. Given zkSync’s blistering rate of development and ability to continually hit their aggressive deadlines, we have prioritized them as <i>the L2 protocol</i> to work with. Our trust in them has only grown since leading their <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/matter-labs-raises-2m-to-bring-scalability-to-ethereum-with-zero-knowledge-proofs-300923258.html"><strong>seed round in 2019</strong></a>, and once they have helped to scale Ethereum, the world of possibility will continue to open for this talented community of builders.</p><p>To learn more, we encourage you to <a href="https://zksync.io/"><strong>check out their website</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zksync"><strong>follow them on Twitter</strong></a>, <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs"><strong>read their Medium</strong></a>, and peruse their <a href="https://www.notion.so/Career-at-Matter-Labs-4a69ed0f7acb45c89f662cf12dbc2464"><strong>open positions</strong></a>.</p>',

                'body' => '<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp"><strong>Yield</strong></a> is one of the most important primitives in financial markets. Alongside <i>gains</i>, it’s an expression of investment profits. But whereas gains come from changes in the <i>price</i> of an asset – and are only realized when the asset is sold – yield is a measure of cash flows generated and distributed to the asset’s holder. They are different things, but yield informs the price of an asset and vice versa.</p><p>For example, you can profit from an investment in a company’s stock by selling shares at a higher price (gains) or when the company distributes excess profits in the form of dividends (yield). You may then value the stock as a function of its cash flows, as is common in securities analysis. Similarly, the interest rate paid by a borrower in a loan contract is the yield earned by the lender, and the market value of that contract is a function of its expected yield. Yield is expressed in percentage terms: a division of cash flows by the size of the underlying investment (e.g. a $100,000 investment that produces cash flows of $5,000 per year, yields 5%).</p><p>Yield is how many DeFi protocols reward active participants. For example, decentralized exchanges like 0x, Uniswap, and Balancer compensate market makers and liquidity providers who stake in those protocols with income derived from trading fees. Credit marketplaces like Aave and Compound pay lenders much of the interest rate paid by borrowers, and “robo-advisors” like Yearn maximize yield across a variety of underlying strategies. You may also earn yield from Proof-of-Stake systems like ETH2 or Decred.&nbsp;</p><p>When you stake in most DeFi protocols you get back tokens that are redeemable for your initial deposit plus any yield generated throughout the duration of your stake. In Aave, these are “a-tokens”, in Compound “c-tokens”, and in most AMM dexes these are called “LP” tokens. But these come with capital-efficiency problems. First, the yield rates are usually market-based and thus variable and often volatile, so you have no certainty about the ultimate value until redemption. Second, your deposit is locked for the duration of your stake. It’s still yours, but you can’t use it elsewhere for the duration of your deposit.</p><p>For example, if you stake 10,000 USDC in Aave, the current annual yield (as of writing) is about 8.92% – but there’s no way to know if the next three or six months will yield more or less. You have no access to your principal (the 10,000 USDC deposit) while it’s staked in the protocol, which prevents you from leveraging that capital elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://element.fi/"><strong>Element</strong></a> is a protocol that allows developers and investors to harness the power of yield in their applications and strategies by addressing these two issues as a layer on top of yield-generating protocols. It works by separating the <i>principal </i>from the<i> interest</i> of a given stake into two separate, tradable tokens: <i>Principal Tokens</i> and <i>Interest Tokens</i>. At the end of a set term (e.g. 3 or 6 months) your each Principal Token is redeemable for a proportional share of the initial stake, while your Interest Tokens are redeemable for the yield generated by the principal over the same time period.</p><p>For example, if you pursued the same 10,000 USDC Aave strategy <i>through</i> Element over a 12-month term, you would get 10,000 Principal Tokens redeemable for 10,000 USDC in a year, and 10,000 Interest Tokens redeemable for however much interest is generated on Aave over that year. If the average rate turned out to be 10%, then the interest tokens would have a terminal value of about 1,000 USDC (or 0.1 USDC per Interest Token).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a powerful trick. Here are just a few things you can do once you separate the yield from the principal:</p><p>First, your principal interest is now liquid. Keeping our example, your 10,000 USDC is still locked in Aave for a year, but you now have an equivalent amount of Principal Tokens which you can sell at a discount to account for the lockup. The market might be interested in buying your 10,000 USDC principal tokens for 9,400 USDC, thus securing a fixed yield of 6%. This new instrument solves the problem of unknown yield.&nbsp;</p><p>Principal tokens trading at a market discount function like zero-coupon bonds and unlock a whole new asset class in DeFi. Many investors will gravitate towards fixed yield instruments, creating demand for principal tokens while their sellers gain access to most of their principal. These become naturally appreciating assets that provide exposure to stable interest, as an alternative to collateralized lending markets which can require constant movement of funds. If you are <i>long</i> the underlying base asset, it’s also an effective way to acquire them at a discounted price to market, further boosting your expected returns.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquid Interest Tokens give you a lot of flexibility as well. You can sell your principal tokens and hold onto your interest tokens, or you can sell your interest tokens and hold onto your principal tokens, accessing some of tomorrow’s yield <i>today</i>. Or you can sell both! New markets and compounding strategies are bound to emerge (for example, you can re-stake your principal to gain leveraged exposure to yield).&nbsp;</p><p>Element also makes it much easier to switch strategies. If you wanted to move your 10,000 USDC from Aave to Curve, for example, instead of un-staking from Aave and re-staking in Curve, you could just trade your principal or interest tokens from one strategy to another through a decentralized exchange, saving time and money.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s most interesting to me is what can happen once markets form around these new DeFi primitives. Just as every investor in the world pays attention to the national bond markets and interest rates, investors in DeFi can glean valuable information from the markets for principal and interest tokens. Higher or lower fixed yields on principal tokens provide certain kinds of information, as do higher or lower prices on variable interest tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>Higher discounts on principal tokens can mean investors expect higher risk-adjusted returns in the broader market, but it could also be a signal of higher principal risk in the underlying strategy (e.g. a potential hack and recovery). Growing prices for interest tokens on USDC deposits in lending protocols like Aave or Compound can mean the market expects interest rates to rise, while decreasing prices for interest tokens on LP stakes in an AMM DEX could mean the market expects trading volume and fees to decline.</p><p>In principle, increasing capital efficiency is key to scaling DeFi to the next order of magnitude, as it helps attract larger and larger pools of capital. Today, on the heels of its first public launch, we’re only scratching the surface of what’s possible with Element. We’re excited to see these ideas in practice and look forward to the many experiments this protocol will catalyze.&nbsp;</p><p>To dive deeper into Element, take a look at the construction paper at <a href="https://paper.element.fi/"><strong>https://paper.element.fi</strong></a> and follow the team at <a href="https://twitter.com/element_fi"><strong>@element_fi</strong></a> on Twitter.</p>',

                'body' => '<p>The term ’institutional isomorphism’ refers to similarities in the structure and processes of independent organizations. In the past, the spread of information and the adoption of similar practices was slower and often limited to organizations within a single country or region. But in the newly emerging institutional field of blockchain networks and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) [1], which benefit from near-instant global communications via the Internet, isomorphism develops much faster.</p><p>In their 1983 paper titled “The Iron Cage Revisited: Institutional Isomorphism and Collective Rationality in Organizational Fields,“ DiMaggio and Powell [<a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF9200/v10/readings/papers/DeMaggio.pdf"><strong>2</strong></a>] discuss three forms of isomorphic change: normative, mimetic, and coercive.</p><p><i>Normative isomorphism</i> is driven by professionalization, reflected in specialized vocabularies, job descriptions, educational requirements, and other shared norms and standards that guide individuals in a particular field to think and behave in similar ways.</p><p><i>Mimetic isomorphism</i> is driven by imitation. Organizations are often faced with uncertainty, both in terms of their external environment and a lack of clarity about internal goals and strategy. A common way of dealing with uncertainty is to mimic other organizations, especially those that are perceived as successful or otherwise exemplary.</p><p><i>Coercive isomorphism</i> is driven by external forces. Organizations may be pressured by an external authority to conform to certain expectations. Typical examples include legal or regulatory mandates, reporting or supervisory obligations, and pressure from entities that provide organizations with funding or other essential resources.</p><p>The extent of isomorphism in DAO governance [3] needs to be empirically studied before claiming that, despite many surface-level differences between independent DAOs, the field as a whole is converging on a relatively small number of core ideas and practices. Some similarities in the governance of DAOs are technologically determined. For example, all DAOs rely on digital information and communications technology (ICT), especially blockchain networks and innovative cryptographic protocols, but also more traditional digital infrastructure and services such as the Internet, social media, and online collaboration platforms (most notably Github, Discourse, Discord, Twitter, and Telegram). But there is additional evidence suggesting that the ’<a href="https://www.fehrsam.xyz/blog/blockchain-governance-programming-our-future"><strong>Cambrian explosion</strong></a>’ of blockchain-based economic and governance experiments is increasingly counterbalanced by all three forms of institutional isomorphism discussed by DiMaggio and Powell. Here are three examples of each:</p><p>Normative isomorphism:</p><p>Blockchain industry has ideological roots in the cypherpunk and open source software movements. This affects how different ideas and practices are received within the industry and contributes to the reproduction of specific design preferences, social norms, and intellectual dispositions. An example of that is decentralized applications adopting the principles and ethos associated with their underlying networks. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQS7WuQtXWs"><strong>4</strong></a>]</p><p>Thought leadership and recommendations from reputable individuals or organizations are a key source of normative guidance on DAO governance. Although by no means universally adopted, examples include the preference for software-based automation over human involvement and the use of delegation mechanisms to counter voter apathy. Similarly, concepts such as ’social scaling’, ’governance minimization’, ’credible neutrality’, ’progressive decentralization’, and ’protocol politicians’ have been normatively relied on in designing governance mechanisms for a variety of different DAOs.</p><p>In addition to technical specialization in network operation, software development, and cybersecurity, other areas of DAO governance are also increasingly professionalized (e.g. treasury management, financial analysis, or coordinating the governance proposal and voting procedures). Professionalization of DAO governance encourages homogenization. In the future, this trend may be amplified by the growing importance of professional networks, trade associations, and industry-specific educational and training programs.</p><p>Mimetic isomorphism:</p><p>Many DAOs have adopted governance mechanisms pioneered by the earliest public blockchain networks. Most importantly, these include the use of network-specific coins or tokens to incentivize work and assign access or voting rights, and a standardized process for suggesting changes to the system (usually following the example of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, itself inspired by BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals).</p><p>Founding documents describing the core features of a given DAO often include an (explicit or implicit) ideological position on the relative merits of formal vs. informal and ’on-chain’ vs. ’off-chain’ governance. [<a href="https://mariolaul.medium.com/ten-theses-on-decentralized-network-governance-c1a24a9d59c7"><strong>5</strong></a>] Based on that initial position, many DAOs have modeled themselves – consciously or not – either after Bitcoin and Ethereum (limited on-chain governance combined with semi-formalized off-chain governance) or the early pioneers in token-based voting and treasury management (e.g. Decred and Tezos; more expansive on-chain governance).</p><p>Faced with high technological uncertainty and not much experience to go by, DAOs often integrate battle-tested code, operational procedures, and tools for governance that other DAOs are using. Compared to traditional organizations, this is much easier for DAOs because many blockchain projects are committed to open sourcing their software which is also highly composable if created for the same platform, as is the case with decentralized financial (<a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-list"><strong>DeFi</strong></a>) and governance applications on Ethereum. Examples include broad adoption of the Gnosis <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/"><strong>multisig wallet</strong></a>, Compound’s <a href="https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master/contracts/Governance"><strong>governance contract</strong></a>, and the <a href="https://snapshot.vote/"><strong>Snapshot</strong></a> tool for off-chain voting. In other ecosystems that enable interoperability between different networks and DAOs, some mimetic isomorphism will inevitably result from the use of common development frameworks such as the <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk"><strong>Cosmos SDK</strong></a> and <a href="https://substrate.dev/"><strong>Substrate</strong></a>.</p><p>Coercive isomorphism:</p><p>Many blockchain networks and DAOs aim to achieve meaningful decentralization and censorship-resistance, which presents a unique challenge from a regulatory point of view. Operating in a legal gray area – as is often the case with innovative technology – encourages regulatory arbitrage whereby the core entities participating in DAOs end up domiciled in jurisdictions that take a more permissive view of their activities. One way to interpret this is that existing regulations drive DAOs to adopt similar legal and organizational forms. As blockchain-related regulatory clarity and enforcement grows, this type of isomorphism is likely to increase.</p><p>Engaging in commercial activities and coordinating financial flows from the organization to its contributors or from its users to the organization means that economic entities participating in DAOs may be subject to various tax and reporting obligations. The administrative procedures for meeting these obligations are likely to standardize across a variety of DAOs, similar to how tax and reporting requirements drive isomorphic change in more traditional organizations. It is also possible that the ICT-native and inherently global nature of DAOs will eventually trigger a move towards a more globally unified taxation and recordkeeping regime in general. [6]</p><p>In addition to governments and regulatory bodies, blockchain networks and DAOs may develop dependencies towards other external entities. This may include sources of funding, hardware manufacturers, or other organizations (including other DAOs) that provide resources necessary for DAOs to remain operational. In some cases, such dependencies may grow large enough to allow these external entities to pressure DAOs to adopt certain practices. The degree to which decentralized network operators or other participants in DAOs are currently subject to such pressures is unclear and may remain unreported for long periods of time, especially in the case of organizations that have few alternatives but to quietly succumb to external force.</p><p>Many of the characteristics that lead to isomorphism in organizational fields already apply to DAOs. These include technological uncertainty, relatively few well-established organizational models, an increasingly professionalized labor force, and a growing number of interactions with agencies of the state. On the other hand, DiMaggio and Powell also suggest that isomorphic tendencies are greater when the resource supply of organizations is centralized or when organizations are dependent on support and legitimization by external entities. This is the exact opposite of what many DAOs aspire to achieve, namely maximal decentralization and<a href="https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/7/31/sovereign-cryptonetworks"><strong> sovereignty</strong></a>. And given that DAOs are often set up to run radically new experiments, growing isomorphism in DAO governance is not a foregone conclusion, even though that is what the anecdotal evidence discussed above seems to support.</p><p>Most DAOs are faced with a similar set of fundamental questions. What is the DAO’s purpose? How to incentivize contributions towards that purpose? How does the DAO allocate its resources<a href="https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2021/4/1/the-original-sin"><strong> initially</strong></a> and over time? What is the appropriate legal structure for participants in the DAO? How are decisions about the DAO made and executed? Varying degrees of isomorphism in DAO governance are simply a reflection of how different organizations are answering these questions. For any DAO, becoming more or less similar to others in the field should never be a goal in itself. Instead, each organizational practice – isomorphic or not – should be assessed independently before deciding whether it is something to be resisted or embraced.</p><p>Much more important than differences or similarities between organizational practices are the effects that these practices have on the people involved and the society at large. It is natural for humans to conform to the more popular views in their respective fields, or at least the views of those they admire or depend on. Regulators, investors, prominent commentators, and members of the most successful DAOs should therefore recognize the normative effect of their words and actions on how the majority of DAOs are likely to be structured and governed. Because once certain thought and behavioral patterns become widely adopted, it often becomes exceedingly difficult to reverse the systemic tendencies that these patterns generate.</p><p>As long as conditions are favorable for the free expression of human imagination, there will always be variation in how different groups of people organize and what they create. But humans also imitate each other, model their organizations after existing ones, and – whether they like it or not – live in a society where certain institutions have acquired the power to prescribe and enforce certain actions. The field of DAOs is fully embedded in this reality, characterized by the interplay between diversity and innovation on the one hand, and isomorphism and institutionalization on the other. The more transparent, communicative, and critically self-reflective this field becomes, the better its chances of avoiding the typical pitfalls of more traditional forms of organization that it seeks to provide alternatives for.</p><p>References</p><p>[1] Throughout the text, ‘DAOs’ is used generically to refer to all public blockchain networks, applications, and their respective communities, regardless of whether these have been previously described as decentralized autonomous organizations or not. The exact definitions of and differences between ‘blockchain networks’, ‘decentralized applications’, and ‘DAOs’ is an important topic to discuss. But for the purposes of this text, all are viewed as belonging to the same general category of organizing that combines open source software protocols and distributed computer networks with more conventional forms of both offline and online collaboration.</p><p>[2] DiMaggio, P.

                'body' => '<p>This piece is about one thing: what is the initial distribution of the capital that underpins a cryptonetwork? In a recent conversation between the Placeholder and USV teams, Fred Wilson commented that with organizations he’s experienced going south over time it can often be traced back to an original sin at inception (team, approach, economics or any other pivotal decision). For crypto, an original sin we regularly observe is insiders owning too much of systems that are marketed as public, egalitarian networks.&nbsp;</p><p>While “fair distribution” is a normative judgment, it flows from what we see as a consensus belief within crypto: creating level playing-fields where everyone has a chance at financial sovereignty. If a small group of insiders regularly take ~half of the fully-diluted upside (which is common), we’re seriously kneecapping the redistributive effects of this technology in order to make a handful of people obscenely rich. Truth is, those people are going to do phenomenally well even if they took less, they are just autopilot taking as much as they can, justifying it with “this is how things have always been done” or false claims of “muh fiduciary duty.”&nbsp;</p><p>We are working to build permissionless, open tech. Most of the process is open, but the part that remains the most closed and shrouded in secrecy is the early-stage financing. While this is in-part regulatorily and social norms driven, the more sinister component is insiders can disproportionately tilt the scales in their favor while keeping the details hidden from public view. The more early-stage investors get away with edgy behavior, the more emboldened and empowered they become, to the point where this power becomes detrimental to the health of the space as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the veil of this opacity the same norms and structures that have imbalanced past wealth and power distributions are at play. If we don’t openly address what’s going on at the inception of cryptonetworks, then we are bound to repeat the same past societal mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Where the capital accrues, so too will the power.</i></p><p>The two groups of individuals most intimately involved in the initial creation and distribution of capital are entrepreneurs and early-stage investors (either in VC, HF, or hybrid structures in crypto). Entrepreneurs want to build something, and unless they have the money to support themselves and their team independently, they turn to early-stage investors that fork over risk capital to fund the journey. While crypto has often demonized this process, it can be a healthy and helpful one that allows an entrepreneur with zero wealth to take risk on an idea and if it succeeds, get significant upside, and if it fails, walk off into the sunset without indentured servitude.</p><p>There is another world though where the relationship becomes unhealthy, especially in situations where there’s an opportunistic investor that is aware of the asymmetric distribution of information between the investor and entrepreneur, combined with an inexperienced entrepreneur. First-time entrepreneurs, beware. We have seen it frequently enough, in enough deals, to know that predatory behavior at the early-stage is more common than it should be in crypto.</p><p>This asymmetric upper hand gives the investor home-field advantage, and so long as they are able to get the entrepreneur to agree to legal agreements before any other investor says those agreements are unreasonable, then an entrepreneur can agree and the network runs the risk of being forever imbalanced from this original sin.&nbsp;</p><p>As an entrepreneur, a great resource to protect oneself is other entrepreneurs who have already gone through fundraises. Ask them about the reputations of different investors, things they regret, what they deem as fair, etc. If you’re considering a lead investor, you should be able to talk with any network(s) from that investor’s portfolio to get references on the investor -- references need not be one-sided. Furthermore, try to get more than one term sheet, if you can. These are a couple of simple steps to protect yourself as an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p><p>If we want structural social change, then entrepreneurs and investors need to work together on what we want that change to be. If we don’t, the default is the way things have always been done. While crypto is a massively deflationary and leveling technology that directionally opens up access to capital, there’s a wide range of how (re)distributive<i> </i>crypto will be depending on the social norms we tolerate and endorse.</p><p>At Placeholder we have targeted 1-5% <i>network ownership</i> on a fully-diluted basis, with Placeholder’s most concentrated position coming in at 7% ownership fully-diluted. Some may argue this is still too high, but it’s a far cry from the 10-20% ownership of companies that private equity investors target. And that is fitting; <a href="https://medium.com/@cburniske/cryptonetworks-are-not-companies-a307ad6a61ae"><strong>cryptonetworks are emerging economies that use a protocol in place of a corporation or the government, specialize in a limited set of services, and are capable of global scale from inception.</strong></a> We hypothesize their scale, promise, and diverse set of stakeholders require more evenly distributed ownership than a company, to be maximally effective (companies don’t use equity to supercharge supply-side and demand-side growth, the way cryptonetworks regularly use their cryptoassets).</p><p>Zooming out beyond ourselves, when capital is first distributed, Placeholder advocates for “25% insider, 75% outsider splits (outsiders get 3x what insiders do).” By insiders, we refer to the core team, pre-launch investors, and close advisors -- everyone who takes a risk that the venture may go to zero and that their labor and capital is lost. 25% might sound like too much for insiders to some -- for example, Bitcoiners have long bemoaned Zcash’s 20% block reward allocation to non-mining network contributions -- but 25% is on the light side of what is a more common 40-50% distribution to insiders.</p><p>But Placeholder isn’t perfect. We don’t always get to this goal, and when we don’t (ie, more than 25% allocated to insiders) it’s often on the basis of anticipating long-tail inflation as a re-distributive and growth tactic over time. Additionally, when governance is handed over to tokenholders, planned supply distribution can be changed (ironically, when outsiders get their hands on a token, they can quickly exhibit insider behavior).</p><p>Another way of looking at the relative distribution is analyzing the multiples that outsiders get relative to insiders. <i>For us, the range of what we see as viable today and that would help society move forward into more equitable lands, is outsiders getting 2-4x of insiders</i>. Insiders represent a much smaller group by number, and so it follows that multiples of the network need to be saved for the permissionless public.&nbsp;</p><p>To hit this goal, insiders are allocated 20-33% of a network fully-diluted to get it off the ground. Within this insider allocation, we aim for entrepreneurs to get ~2x what investors get; the team is more important than the investors, and should be valued as such. The permissionless public then receives 67-80% of the initially distributed supply (2x insiders at low end, 4x insiders at high end).&nbsp;</p><p>There are some that would say that there should be no private funding rounds at all, just like Bitcoin. Depending on the objectives of the project, this may indeed be a viable alternative for some networks and entrepreneurs (see how <a href="https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis"><strong>Decred</strong></a> funded itself).&nbsp;We look forward to seeing more experiments along these lines, and potentially supporting them in the public markets.</p><p>As an entrepreneur, the important thing to remember is that you get to decide what you think is the fairest distribution of the network you\'re creating, and then find investors who match those values. If you prefer more concentrated ownership, seek out investors who have similar preferences. If you want to tilt the world towards a more even distribution of capital, don\'t be afraid to make that clear to potential investors, and we at Placeholder would enjoy speaking with you. Once you\'ve moved past inception and initial distribution, the mechanism design of your network will then give you a second shot at sculpting <a href="https://mariolaul.medium.com/resource-distribution-and-power-dynamics-in-decentralized-networks-ab0610bee6e1"><strong>where the power and resources accrue</strong></a>.</p><p>If there’s one thing we all can do, it’s to ask each network, <i>“What is the initial distribution of the capital here, and the reasoning behind that distribution?”</i></p>',

We demonstrate a simple method for recovering a CFMM trading function that produces this desired payoff. This method uses only basic tools from convex analysis and is intimately related to Fenchel conjugacy.
